## Problems
1. Check if any two numbers in a list sum to k.

    This problem was recently asked by Google.
    Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
    For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
    Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

2. Generate new list of numbers using input list of numbers, each entry the product of all numbers other than itself.

    This problem was asked by Uber.
    Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
    For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
    Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
